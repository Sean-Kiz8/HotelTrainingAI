# error-processing-flow

The error processing workflow handles batch operations for 35 files in processing group 0.

Key Processing Paths:
- `/processing/group-0/*` - Primary file batch location
- `/error/group-0/*.err` - Error output location

Error Processing Flow:
1. Batch files are processed in group 0
2. Error detection occurs at file level
3. Failed files are isolated within error directory

Business Importance: 75
- Critical for maintaining data integrity across file batch operations
- Core component of group-based file processing system
- Essential for tracking and managing processing failures
