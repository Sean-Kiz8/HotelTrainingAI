# file-processing-algorithm

Primary batch processing workflow for handling file groups in batch operations.

## Core File Processing Architecture
IMPORTANCE: 85

The system processes files in grouped batches:
- Files are organized into numbered groups (e.g. group 0)
- Processing occurs at the group level
- Error handling tracks failures per group
- Each group can contain up to 35 distinct files

## Error Handling
IMPORTANCE: 90 

The system implements group-level error tracking:
- Errors are captured and associated with specific group IDs
- Critical errors trigger group-wide processing termination
- Error details indicate number of affected files within the group
- Processing errors are tracked for entire group batches (e.g. "Processing error for 35 files in group 0")
