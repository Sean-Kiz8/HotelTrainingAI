# file-processing-algorithm

## Core Processing Logic
A multi-stage batch file processor that organizes files into logical groups for processing. The system encountered a critical error while attempting to process 35 files in group 0.

## Group Management 
Files are organized into numbered groups (starting with group 0) to enable parallel processing and error isolation. Each group represents a distinct processing unit.

## Error Handling
The processor implements group-level error detection and reporting. When errors occur, the system:
1. Identifies the affected group number
2. Tracks the number of impacted files
3. Maintains processing state for error recovery

## Group Processing States
Groups can exist in the following states:
- Active: Currently being processed
- Error: Processing halted due to failures
- Complete: All files successfully processed

Importance Score: 85
Primary business importance due to batch organization and error management capabilities.
