# file-processing-algorithm

The file processing system implements batch handling for grouped files with specific error detection capabilities.

## Groups Processing
Files are organized into numbered groups for batch processing, with Group 0 being a critical processing unit. The system has specific error detection and handling for batch sizes of 35 files per group.

## Error States
Processing errors are tracked at the group level. Current implementation identifies and flags processing failures for:
- Group 0 batch errors
- 35-file batch size violations

## Critical Components
- Group Processing Controller (Importance: 85)
  Manages batch file grouping and processing coordination

- Error Detection Service (Importance: 75)
  Validates group processing completion and identifies batch failures

- File Group Validator (Importance: 70)
  Ensures proper file count and group assignment

## Processing Flow
1. Files are assigned to numbered groups
2. Group 0 receives priority processing
3. System validates 35-file batch integrity
4. Error detection runs per group completion
5. Failed groups are flagged for reprocessing
