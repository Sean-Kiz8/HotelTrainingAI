## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Error Processing System

Basic runtime environment designed to handle batch error processing operations across file groups, specifically focused on Group 0 containing 35 files.

Key Functionality:
- Group-based file error analysis
- Batch processing for error files
- File grouping and categorization

Importance Score: 45
Limited information indicates this is a supporting error handling system with moderate business impact.
