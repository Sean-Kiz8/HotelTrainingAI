## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Error Processing System

The system is configured to handle batch error processing operations, specifically designed to manage and process errors across file groups. Currently focused on processing error conditions for 35 files within group 0.

File Count: 35
Group ID: 0

## Project Scope

The implementation appears to be focused on error handling and processing mechanisms for file batches, with specific emphasis on group-based error management.

Importance Score: 85 - Critical error handling functionality for batch operations
