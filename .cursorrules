## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements error handling for batch file processing operations, specifically focused on error management for 35 files within group 0.

Core Processing Structure:
- File batch processing at group level
- Error detection and aggregation
- Group-based error reporting

Critical Components:
Group Processing Subsystem
- Manages file batches in discrete groups
- Handles errors at both file and group level

Error States:
- Processing failure identified for specific group (group 0)
- File count validation (35 files affected)
